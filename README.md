### OBjectives :

1.Identify the type of models which you will prefer to make for this project.

2.Check whether there are null values or not in the dataset. If null values are there then do the null value imputation. 

3.Check the presence of outliers. Use Boxplot as well suitable mathematical method to detect, If outliers are there for particular features then decide whether you will treat them or not. If yes, do the treatment. 

4.Check for multicollinearity. If it is there do the necessary treatment.

5.Do for successful model building, it requires scaling. If yes, how you encounter it. Explain 

6.Prepare at-least 4 models for this problem statement. 

7.Evaluate your models and select it based on different evaluation parameters, Write significance also. 

8.Identify the features which you think are the most needed for good installments prediction. 

9.Predict installments for at-least 10 data points. 

10.Mention the business scope of this project.



Predicted Google Play Store installations using givenÂ features. Performed feature engineering, outlier detection, missing value imputation, column transformation on the dataset and trained multiple models to produce the least mean square error, with XGBoost yielding the best results. MSE: 0.100
RMSE: 0.316 R-squared: 0.9098
